\chapter{Architecture}
\label{ch:architecture}
% ************************************************

In this chapter we outline the architecture and composition of the
application {\platener}. Therefore, we look at concepts of graphics
programming in web-environments in Section~\ref{sec:cg-web}. Then, we
explore the structure of our software from two points of view. At
first, we present {\convertify} in
Section~\ref{sec:framework-convertify}. {\convertify} is the
web-framework in which {\platener} is implemented. Secondly, we
explain the details of {\platener} in
Section~\ref{sec:application-platener}.
