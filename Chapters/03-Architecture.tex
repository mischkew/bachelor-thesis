\chapter{Architecture}
\label{ch:architecture}
% ************************************************

In this chapter we outline the architecture and composition of the
application {\platener}. Our software is implemented in our web
framework {\convertify}. The framework allows building interactive
WebGL applications in a modular manner. Features are decoupled into
plugins. Each application implements its {\userinterface}
independently from {\convertify}.

We introduce the concepts of graphics programming in web
environments in Section~\sectionref{sec:cg-web}. The design of {\convertify}
is explained in Section~\sectionref{sec:framework-convertify}. Finally, we
give details of the structure of {\platener} in
Section~\sectionref{sec:application-platener}.

% Then, we
% explore the structure of our software from two points of view. At
% first, we present {\convertify} in
% Section~\sectionref{sec:framework-convertify}. {\convertify} is the
% web-framework in which {\platener} is implemented. Secondly, we
% explain the details of {\platener} in
% Section~\sectionref{sec:application-platener}.
